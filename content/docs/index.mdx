description: A shadcn-based UI system focused on ownership, flexibility, and clean design. Build with components you fully control, designed to scale with your product rather than constrain it.

Another UI is a shadcn-based UI system built for developers who want full control without sacrificing quality. It delivers well-designed, production-ready components that live directly in your codebase and evolve with your product.

It follows the same core philosophy as shadcn: copy the code, own it, and shape it to your needs. No hidden abstractions. No rigid APIs. Just clean, readable components you can trust and extend.

Built on top of shadcn and enhanced with subtle GSAP animations, Another UI focuses on performance, accessibility, and composability. Every component is designed to be practical, adaptable, and easy to reason about in real-world applications.

### Why Another UI?

Shadcn showed that developers prefer ownership over convenience.
Another UI takes that idea further by providing a more opinionated design direction while keeping full control in your hands.

It is not a framework.
It is not a drop-in UI kit.

It is a curated system of components designed to be modified, reshaped, and fully owned by the developer.

Another UI exists for those who want structure without restriction, consistency without lock-in, and design that feels intentional rather than imposed.

It gives you a strong foundation — and trusts you to build on it.
